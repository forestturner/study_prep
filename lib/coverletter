Dear HoneyBook,


I am a Software Developer / Web Developer in San Francisco. I recently graduated from App Academy, an intensive web development school in San Francisco, CA. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from California State University Long Beach. I have a strong background in Ruby, JavaScript, and SQL, as well as frameworks such as React and Rails.


I have a love for puzzles, optimization, and beautiful simplistic algorithms  which helps for making beautiful, fast, easy-to-use applications. My recent project, FutonSurfing.site, showcases these details extremely well. I paid attention to every detail in UX development while still keeping UI design in the back of my mind. I used React along with Redux to portray a feeling of seamless flow of data and user interactions.


In addition to my extensive coding skills, I have an understanding of algorithm solving such as amortized analysis that can help the efficiency of retrieving data from a database. My recent time at App Academy has provided me with hundreds of hours of experience with pair programming and working in team situations. I am looking forward to hearing back from someone at HoneyBook, so I can further demonstrate my ability to code and build efficient websites.



Sincerely,


Forest Turner
